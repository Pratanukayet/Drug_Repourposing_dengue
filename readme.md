Drug Repurposing for Dengue using FCNN
This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for drug repurposing targeting the dengue virus. The project leverages advanced embeddings for drug and protein representations, combined with a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), to predict dissociation constant (Kd) values for drug-target interactions.

Overview
Drug repurposing accelerates drug discovery by identifying novel uses for existing drugs. This project integrates diverse molecular and biological data to predict drug-protein interactions, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic options for dengue.
